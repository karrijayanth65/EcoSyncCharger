Battery (optional): Stores energy for use when sunlight is not available.
Circuit Diagram

How It Works
Solar Panel: The solar panel collects sunlight and converts it into DC electricity.
Voltage Regulation: The embedded circuit regulates the voltage to a stable level suitable for charging mobile devices.
Charging: The regulated power is delivered to the USB output port, which can be connected to a mobile device for charging.
Installation and Setup
Assemble the Components: Connect the solar panel, embedded circuit, and USB port according to the circuit diagram.
Test the Circuit: Ensure that the voltage output is stable and within the required range (typically 5V for USB charging).
Encapsulation: Encapsulate the components in a protective case to safeguard against environmental factors.
Usage
Place the solar panel in direct sunlight.
Connect your mobile device to the USB output port using a USB cable.
The device should start charging immediately if there is sufficient sunlight.
